# Quantum IDE

A desktop quantum computing IDE built with Electron, React, and Vite. Write circuits in a custom assembly language, simulate them with a hand-rolled JavaScript state-vector engine, and inspect results through a live circuit diagram, probability bars, Bloch sphere, and measurement histogram. No cloud account, no Python, no third-party quantum libraries required.

## Features

- **Custom DSL** -- line-based quantum assembly with gates, rotations, measurement, barriers, and user-defined reusable gates
- **State-vector simulator** -- pure JavaScript, up to 8 qubits, all gate math written from the unitary definitions
- **Circuit diagram** -- SVG auto-generated from parsed instructions, highlights the active gate during step-through
- **Step-through debugger** -- execute one instruction at a time and watch amplitudes update live
- **Bloch sphere** -- per-qubit visualization computed by partial trace, shown as a 2D SVG projection
- **Multi-shot histogram** -- run the circuit up to 10,000 times and plot outcome statistics
- **OpenQASM 2.0 import/export** -- convert to and from the standard format used by IBM Quantum and others
- **Undo/redo** -- full editor history (100 states)
- **File I/O** -- native save/open dialogs for `.qs` and `.qasm` files via Electron
- **Extended gate set** -- CZ, CS, CT, CCX (Toffoli), CSWAP (Fredkin), plus all standard single-qubit and rotation gates
- **Custom gate definitions** -- define named sub-circuits inline and call them like built-in gates
- **Noise simulation** -- density matrix mode with depolarizing, amplitude damping, and phase flip channels
- **13 built-in examples** -- Bell state, GHZ, Grover search, teleportation, Deutsch-Jozsa, QFT, and more

## Project Structure

```
src/
  engine/             # Pure JS quantum engine -- no React, no DOM dependencies
    complex.js        # Complex number arithmetic ([re, im] tuples)
    gates.js          # Gate matrix definitions
    parser.js         # DSL text -> instruction objects + custom gate registry
    simulator.js      # State-vector simulation, measurement, multi-shot, Bloch vectors
    densityMatrix.js  # Density matrix operations and Kraus noise channels
    qasm.js           # OpenQASM 2.0 import/export
  components/         # React UI components
  data/examples.js    # Built-in example programs
  styles/
    tokens.js         # Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
    index.css         # Global styles

electron/
  main.cjs            # Electron main process
  preload.cjs         # contextBridge (file dialogs, window title)
```

The engine and UI are fully decoupled -- `src/engine/` has zero React imports and works in Node.js or any browser context unchanged.

## Adding a Gate

1. Define the 2x2 matrix in `src/engine/gates.js` and register it in `FIXED_GATES` (or `ROTATION_GATES` for parameterized gates)
2. Add the name to the relevant set in `src/engine/parser.js`
3. Add a `case` in `executeInstruction` in `simulator.js` if it needs custom dispatch logic
4. Add a symbol renderer in `CircuitDiagram.jsx`

## Built-in Examples

| Name | What it shows |
|---|---|

| Custom Gate | Defining and calling a reusable Bell gate |
| Bell State -- Statistics | 1000-shot run showing the 50/50 histogram |

## How the Simulator Works

The state vector is an array of `2^n` complex amplitudes stored as `[re, im]` pairs. Qubit ordering is little-endian (qubit 0 = least significant bit), matching Qiskit's convention.

Gate application iterates over amplitude pairs that differ only in the target qubit's bit position -- O(2^n) per gate instead of O(4^n) for full matrix multiplication. Measurement follows the Born rule and collapses the state in place.

The density matrix engine handles noise simulation using Kraus operators. Gate application becomes `U * rho * U†`, and noise channels (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase flip) are applied after each gate.
